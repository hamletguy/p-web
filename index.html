        The La Voiture Noire is a one-off special introduced at the 2019 Geneva
        Motor Show. Based on the Chiron, the design of the car harkens back to
        the Type 57 SC Atlantic and is a celebration of the company's
        distinctive design history. The car has a hand-built body made from
        carbon fibre designed by Bugatti designer Etienne Salomé which has an
        elongated nose (similar to that on the Divo) and an elongated back
        section. Other notable features include unique wing mirrors, LED
        taillight strip, and wheels. Unlike the original, the car has a
        mid-engine layout.

        Lamborghini created the Aventador SVJ to embrace challenges head-on,
        combining cutting-edge technology with extraordinary design, while
        always refusing to compromise. In a future driven by technology, it’s
        easy to lose the genuine thrill of driving. But in the future shaped by
        Lamborghini, this won’t be left behind, because there will always be a
        driver behind the wheel.
